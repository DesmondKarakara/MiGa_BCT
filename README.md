## Notes
With the arrival of a world deeply entrenched in digital experiences, casual gaming has transitioned from a fun novelty to a key feature of entertainment, socialization, and learning.

With a world based on web, and an increase and movement toward mobile-first play experiences, there is an insatiable demand for lightweight, real-time, interactive games that can be consumed anywhere and anytime.

MiGa (Mini Games) is a modular Angular-based web application designed to provide a collection of mini-games that are simple, fun, and skill-enhancing in learning.

MiGa provides a collection of short games such as Rock-Paper-Scissors, Find the Mole, Guess the Number, Reaction Time, and a simple Traffic Simulator. Each game uses base JavaScript logic, as well as the Angular component architecture to ensure a seamless user experience across devices.

MiGa has been created in Angular for the front end and built with every reusable component, routing, and modular CSS, allowing MiGa to be uniquely extendable for optional use in platforms focused on casual gaming.

The purity of MiGa focuses on simple fun parts of play-based engagements, quick-pick play, and visual feedback to hold user interest and engagement in play, so any user in any age group can interact in simple gaming activities.
